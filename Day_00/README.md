# Getting Started

## Topics covered in today's module
* What is a GPU?:  GPU stands for Graphic Processing Unit. It is the main graphics processing chip on your third-party graphics card or motherboard. The GPU is dedicated to performing the often-intensive calculations that are required to render images, videos, and animations on your computer. A GPU works in a similar way to a CPU—it performs calculations at an incredibly fast rate. The main job of a GPU is to take on the calculations relating to graphics so that the CPU can get on with the job of handling everything else.
Since it’s a separate chip, it can perform its calculations at the same time as the CPU, freeing up processing power for other tasks.

* Python base library basics: A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer.

* Numpy basics
* Pandas basics
